    - (~23 ns) for a 512-point NTT
    - they implemented 1D-systolic array using Vivado synthesis tool
    - The computational efficiency of a polynomial multiplier can be significantly improved to O(n) by modifying the systolic architecture to include a 
    series of n multiply-accumulate units (MACs).

Hardware Design of an n-coefficient NTT-Based Polynomial Multiplier

    - (4.35 ns) for a 512-point NTT
    - implemented in pure verilog using quartus 2

    - (10.75 us) To multiply two polynomials using NTT-based multipliers,we need to execute NTT block three times, and each includes bit-reversal, forward NTT, and point-wised multiplication of 
    the input vector with the pre-computed twiddle factors
    - they used Vivado high level synthesis (HLS) 2018.2 and select Artix7 and Zynq UltraScale+ as the target FPGA

    - they used Gemmini and ZigZag in their experiments and desgin space exploration

Accelerating Polynomial Multiplication for RLWE using Pipelined FFT
    - linK: https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1815.pdf
    - they implemented three approaches and used Vivado synthesis HLS tool
